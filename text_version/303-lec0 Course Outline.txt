1 OVERVIEW

3

1 Overview
Welcome to COMP 303! Please read this document carefully and keep it for reference
throughout the term.
This course provides an in-depth introduction to the discipline of software design for building
realistic and high-quality software applications. It will focus on object-oriented programming
techniques, and cover topics related to managing software complexity and verifying that they
work as expected.

1.1 Primary Learning Objectives
By the end of this course, you should be able to:
• Properly explain and apply general Design Principles (separation of concerns, encapsulation, substitutability, interface segregation, etc.) and important Design patterns.
• Properly explain and apply design techniques such as UML Diagrams and Design by
Contract.
• Eﬀective use programming language mechanisms such as exception handling and reﬂection.
• Analyze and evaluate the quality of design solutions; correctly identify design smells
and apply appropriate refactoring to eliminate them.
• Gain experience on software development tools such as modern IDEs, automatic documentation and testing tools, and version control system.

1.2 Course prerequisites
Students must have taken the following pre-requisite courses before taking this course:
• COMP 250
• COMP 206
Students are also encouraged to take a self-assessment test to check if they have the necessary
competencies.

2 COURSE MATERIALS

4

2 Course materials
2.1 Recordings, slides and exercises
Lecture recordings and slides will be made available to students on myCourses. Note that
recording quality is on a best-eﬀort basis, and students are strongly encouraged to attend
the lectures in person.

2.2 Textbook and other references
Readings will be assigned at the end of most lectures from Introduction to Software
Design with Java, 2nd ed., by Prof. Martin Robillard, available at no cost to McGill
students through the McGill Library. There is also a companion website for the textbook
which contains source code, exercises and solutions, and another which contains solutions
annotated with extra explanations.
We may also cite from The Pragmatic Programmer by David Thomas and Andrew Hunt
and Eﬀective Java by Joshua Bloch.

2.3 Copyright policy
You are not allowed to post any course materials online, including but not limited to GitHub,
Course Hero, or any other websites. Course materials include but are not limited to video
recordings, PDFs of lecture slides, tutorials, recommended exercises, assignment questions,
project code or anything else provided to you during the course.
Stated more formally: Instructor/TA-generated course materials are protected by law and
may not be copied or distributed in any form or in any medium without explicit permission of
the instructor/TA. Infringements of copyright can be subject to follow up by the University
under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.

3 Communication policies
3.1 Oﬃce hours
Teaching Assistants (T.A.s) and the instructor will be available for oﬃce hours each week
to help you with your work and answer questions about the course material.
Oﬃce hours will be held either in person or through Zoom and will be individual (one-on-one).
The oﬃce hour schedule will be shared with you in the ﬁrst weeks of the term. Feel free to
attend as many of these oﬃce hours as you like, whichever best ﬁt with your schedule.

3 COMMUNICATION POLICIES

3.2 Ed Discussion board
We will be using Ed Discussions for class discussion. The system is designed to get you
help fast and eﬃciently from classmates, the TAs and the instructor. Please post all
your questions related to the course content and homework on Ed, rather than
emailing questions to the teaching staﬀ. By using the discussion board, you will
receive an answer faster, and everyone in the class will be able to beneﬁt from it.
Ed Discussion allows you to post privately, if you are unsure that your post should be read
by other students (e.g., because it might give away a solution). It also allows you to post
anonymously if you do not wish to be identiﬁed for some reason.
You may freely answer other students' questions as well, with one important exception: you
may not provide solution code (although you are permitted to provide one or two lines of
code to illustrate a point).
You can access Ed Discussions through a link on our class' myCourses navigation bar.
3.2.1 Discussion board guidelines
We encourage you to share your knowledge and help each other out by answering your
peers' questions on the discussion board. The instructor and TAs will try to moderate the
discussion board, but it works best when students help each other out.
When posting to the discussion board, please obey the following guidelines. Postings that
do not conform may be deleted.
• Search to see if your question has been asked before. Do not make duplicate posts.
• Choose a suitable subject line, so that others know what the post is about.
• If you have multiple unrelated questions, then use multiple postings.
• Proofread before posting. Take an extra minute to ensure what you wrote makes sense.
• Be polite and respectful.
Formally and oﬃcially: The University is committed to maintaining teaching and learning
spaces that are respectful and inclusive for all. To this end, oﬀensive, violent, or harmful
language arising in contexts such as the following may be cause for disciplinary action:
• Zoom sessions, including username (use only your legal or preferred name), virtual
backgrounds, 'chat' boxes, whiteboard annotations, breakout rooms.
• Ed Discussion board.
• Other in-course venues of discussion.

3.3 Contacting the instructor and teaching assistants
For private matters, you can send email to a TA or to your instructor directly with 'COMP
303' in the subject header. Be sure to send your email from your @mail.mcgill.ca address,
and include your student ID. Email sent from non-McGill accounts may be spam-ﬁltered
or simply ignored. A private matter may be, for example, if you are anxious about your
performance in the class and would like to discuss it.
When emailing a TA or instructor, please follow the guidelines on etiquette described in the
video here and on this website.

3.4 Course announcements
Important course information will be announced in class and/or on myCourses and Ed
Discussion. Please subscribe now to myCourses Announcements if you have not already
done so. You are expected to monitor your McGill email, myCourses, and Ed Discussion for
course-related news and information.

4 Methods of Evaluation & Grades
Our course grading scheme is as follows:
• Midterm: 25%
• Final Exam: 45%
• Project: 30%
Rounding: Final course grades will be rounded oﬀ to the nearest integer. If your grade is
84.4 then it will round to 84 (A-), whereas if it is 84.6 then it will round to 85 (A). If your
grade is 84.5, our formula will round it up to 85. The same rounding procedure holds for low
grades. If your calculated ﬁnal course grade is 49.4 then it will round to 49 (F). We draw a
very hard line here, so if you don't want to fail then you should stay far away from that line.

4.1 Midterm
The midterm will take place in the middle of the term, likely during the week after the Study
Break (March 10-14). The exact date and time will be conveyed to you closer to the date.

4.2 Final exam
The ﬁnal exam will take place during the ﬁnal exam period. It will be worth 45%, but if
you do better on it than you do on the midterm, then the midterm will be worth 0% and
the ﬁnal exam will be worth 70%.

4.2.1 Supplemental/deferred exam
Under certain conditions, you may be eligible to write the Supplemental/Deferred exam.
This exam will cover the same material as the Final Exam. For those writing the Deferred
Exam, the exam grade will simply replace the Final Exam grade. For those writing the
Supplemental Exam, a new grade will appear on your transcript which is calculated as
follows: the Supplemental exam grade will replace the Final Exam grade, and your pre-existing midterm/project grades will be used (and hence double counted in the GPA). For
more information on Supplemental and Deferred exams, see here.

4.3 Project
The project will be done in teams of 3, though it will be possible to work alone or in a team
of 2. The project will be worth 30% of your grade and will have deadlines that must be met
throughout the term.
The ﬁrst deadline will be Monday, January 20, at which point teams must be registered. The
registration process will be detailed to you in class in the days leading up to the deadline.
Teams must work together for the remainder of the term, and all partners in the team will
typically receive the same grade.
Here are approximate weeks during which work will be due. Exact deadlines will be communicated to you on the posting of each part.
• Week of Jan. 20: Team forming deadline
• Week of Feb. 3: Project proposal deadline
• Week of Feb. 10: Reviews of project proposal due
• Week of Mar. 10: Halfway mark
• Week of Mar. 31/Apr. 7: Final demo and project submision
4.3.1 Project submissions
Project submission will take place through a system to be described by the instructor at or
around the posting of the project proposal guideline document.
You are responsible for verifying that your submissions are successful. If you believe the
content of your submission is diﬀerent from what you have submitted, you must email your
instructor preferably within a few days of the deadline and provide evidence of your correct
submission.
Furthermore, once grades for an assessment are released, it is your responsibility to check
that your grades are correct and to notify your instructor of any errors.

4.3.2 Late policy
Unforeseen events may arise that prevent you from submitting work on time. For example,
you might be sick for several days in the week before the deadline. Our standard late policy
is that you may submit up to two days after the deadline, but with a small penalty: we will
deduct 10% each day for which they are late, including weekends and holidays; that is, work
that is between 0 and 24 hours late will be deducted 10 points, and work that is between 24
and 48 hours late will be deducted 20 points. We are willing to waive this penalty in cases
of extended illness or other unforeseen personal circumstances. However, you must make a
formal request (see section 3.3 for email policy).
Examples of invalid requests are:
• Your laptop broke or was stolen. This is not a valid excuse. You should be using a
cloud backup system, e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, etc., to be able to access a version
of your ﬁle.
• You have other exams, a job interview, etc. These are invalid because they are not
unexpected and you have two weeks to complete your assigned work. It is your responsibility to plan accordingly.
Work submitted more than 2 days after the deadline will not be accepted, nor graded, and
will therefore receive a grade of 0.
Plan appropriately and do not submit only minutes before the deadline. Requests for waiving
the late penalty because the system was busy or your machine/internet was too slow will not be
accepted. Individual exceptions to the lateness policy will not be granted without appropriate
justiﬁcation submitted in writing and supported by documentary evidence.

4.4 Regrade requests
If you believe that you have been assigned an incorrect grade for one of your assessments,
you can request a regrade. Only well-argumented requests will be considered. You may
request a regrade within only 7 days from when your grade was published. Requests after the
deadline will not be considered.

4.5 Additional work
Students who receive unsatisfactory ﬁnal grades will NOT have the option to submit additional work to improve their grades.

4.6 McGill Language Policy
In accordance with McGill University's Charter of Students' Rights, students in this course
have the right to submit in English or in French any written work that is to be graded.

5 POLICIES ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY

9

Conformément à la Charte des droits de l’étudiant de l’Université McGill, chaque étudiant
a le droit de soumettre en français ou en anglais tout travail écrit devant être noté.

4.7 Extraordinary circumstances beyond the University’s control
In accordance with section 3.2.3 of the University Student Assessment Policy, in the event
of extraordinary circumstances beyond the University’s control, the evaluation scheme in a
Course is subject to change, provided that there be timely communications to the students
regarding the change.

5 Policies on Academic Integrity
Oﬃcial policy: McGill University values academic integrity. All students must understand
the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism, and other academic oﬀences under
the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures (see https://www.mcgill.ca/
integrity/ for more information).

5.1 Plagiarism policy
You must include your name and McGill ID number at the top of each code ﬁle that you
implement and submit. By doing so, you are certifying that the program or module is entirely
your own, and represents only the result of your own eﬀorts.
Work submitted for this course must represent your own eﬀorts. The project must be done
with your registered team; you must not work with anyone else. Do not ask friends or
tutors to do your work for you. You must not copy any other person's work in any manner
(electronically or otherwise), even if this work is in the public domain or you have permission
from its author to use it and/or modify it in your own work (obviously, this prohibition does
not apply to source code supplied by the instructor explicitly for this purpose). To be clear,
you must not copy or view any code from any source, online or otherwise, except the code
written by the instructor during lectures. Furthermore, you must not give a copy of your
work to any other person.
The plagiarism policy is not meant to discourage interaction or discussion among students.
You are encouraged to discuss course and/or project questions with the instructor, TAs and
your fellow students. There is no better way to learn than through discussion with your
peers. You are also encouraged to help each other out with debugging problems, especially
with the basic mechanics of debugging, such as how to make the best use of an IDE. Finally,
you are highly encouraged to post questions on Ed and to answer each other’s questions
there as well. However, there is a diﬀerence between discussing ideas and working in groups
or copying someone else's solution. Your discussion should never go so far that you are
revealing the solutions to each other. Sharing code is absolutely forbidden. The solution
code that you submit must be your own work. A good rule of thumb is that when you

6 LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

10

discuss projects with your fellow students, you should not leave the discussion with written
notes. Also, when you write your solution, you must do it on your own.

5.2 Getting help and partial credit
Students who require assistance should see a TA or the instructor during oﬃce hours or
make use of the Ed discussion board. If you have only partially ﬁnished part of the project,
comment out the parts that do not work, and submit what you managed to complete for
partial credit.
Code ﬁles that do not run at all (syntax or runtime errors) will be heavily penalized and
almost certainly result in a grade of zero, so make sure to submit only working code, even if
it does not fully satisfy the project requirements.

5.3 Plagiarism detection
We will be using automated code similarity detection tools to compare your project submissions to that of all other students registered in the course. These tools are cutting-edge and
are very eﬀective at their job. However, we will not accuse anyone of copying based solely
on the output of these tools. Rather, we will use these tools to determine which submissions
should be manually checked for similarity by the TA and instructor.
When the instructor suspects that plagiarism has occurred, the instructor will report the case
to the Disciplinary Oﬃcer in the student’s Faculty (Science, Arts, Engineering, etc). For
more details on the process, see Section III Articles A.37 (p. 10) and A.48 (p. 13) of the
Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures, which can be found here.

5.4 Posting solutions on a website
You must not share your solutions by posting them on a public space such as GitHub,
CourseHero, etc. This rule extends beyond the duration of the course. The reason for the
rule is that instructors occasionally recycle assignments from previous years, and if the old
versions are easily accessible then such posting can lead to plagiarism by others.

6 Land acknowledgement
McGill University is on land which has long served as a site of meeting and exchange amongst
Indigenous peoples, including the Haudenosaunee and Anishinabeg nations. We acknowledge
and thank the diverse Indigenous people whose footsteps have marked this territory on which
people of the world now gather. Please see here for more details.

This Oﬃce liaises with your instructor on your behalf to ensure that your accommodations
are met and that you can succeed in your studies.

7.2 Pregnancy and caregiving
Students who are pregnant and/or caring for a dependent may ﬁnd it helpful to receive
academic accommodations. McGill's guidelines for accommodations for students who are
pregnant and/or caring for a dependent may be found here.

7.3 Health and Wellness resources
The academic environment at McGill is challenging. Our terms are intensive, and classes
are not the only demanding part of your life. Student well-being is a priority for McGill. If
you need to access services for health and wellness, or if you want to get more information,
please consult our Student Wellness Hub at here, or drop by the Brown Student Services
Building (downtown) or Centennial Centre (Macdonald Campus). Within your faculty, you
can also connect with your Local Wellness Advisor (to make an appointment, visit here).

8 Campus Computer Laboratories
All students registered in COMP 303 may use the School of Computer Science (SOCS)
computer laboratory facilities to do their work regardless of the program in which they are
registered. These facilities are located on the third ﬂoor of the Trottier building. You can
refer to here for more information on the SOCS computer laboratory facilities.
You may also use other computer laboratory facilities on campus to do your work. Most
facilities are available to all students, but there are facilities which grant usage privileges only
to students registered in a course or program oﬀered by the faculty or department which
manages the facility. Students should contact the work area of their choice to inquire about
access requirements, opening hours, or any further information such as software availability.
